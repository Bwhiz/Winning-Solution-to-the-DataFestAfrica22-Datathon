# Winning-Solution-to-the-DataFestAfrica22-Datathon
This contains my team's winning solution to [DataFestAfrica](https://datafestafrica.com/) 2022 Datathon competition.

The First round of the competition was a [Machine Learning Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/datafestafrica-ml-hackathon/leaderboard) hosted on Kaggle, and the second round was an analytics based competition centered around the improvement of a ticket center's performance.

The solution to each round is stored in seperate folders with a naming convention that follows the brief explanation above.
